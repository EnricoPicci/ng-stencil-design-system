# ng-stencil-design-system
Build an example of Angular application which uses a design system library implemented in stencil.
Use Angular version 19.
Use standalone components. Do not use Angular modules.
The example application is a simple "to do" application with the following features:
- The user can add a to-do
- When a to-do is added it is shown in a list
- The user can delete a to-do from the list
- The user can change the to-do clicking on the to-do in the list

The application is a single page application.
At the start it shows an entry field where the user can describe the to-do and a button to add the to-do to the list of to-dos.
Below the entry field there is a list of the to-dos.
At the start the list of to-dos is empty.

Use Angular CLI commands to setup the angular app at the beginnin and in all other cases where they can help, for instance when you have to create components.
